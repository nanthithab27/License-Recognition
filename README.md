License Plate Recognition

A robust and efficient solution for detecting and interpreting vehicle license plates from images and videos.

Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive tool for automatic license plate recognition (ALPR). Utilizing advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques, the system is designed to identify and read license plates in various scenarios and formats.

Features
Real-time License Plate Detection: Identify license plates in real-time from video feeds or static images.
Text Recognition: Extract and decode the text from the detected license plates.
Multi-language Support: Recognize license plates in different languages and formats.

Creating a README for a GitHub repository related to license plate recognition involves providing clear and concise information to help users understand what the project is, how to set it up, and how to use it. Hereâ€™s a template you can adapt for your specific project:
